# frozen_string_literal: true

# This is an integration test for CryptIdent. Integration tests differ from
# unit tests in that they're more use-case oriented; rather than iteratively
# testing every feature and error handler of a module or class, they demonstrate
# a sequence illustrating how the code would be used to "tell an end-to-end
# story". Development-only tools such as test coverage analysis, or mocks of
# framework classes, aren't used.
#
# This test exercises the following sequence of actions:
#
# ## Setup Steps
#
# 1. Register a New User, capturing the Token for use in the following step. The
#    test *does not* otherwise inspect or verify the Result; that is done by
#    other integration tests.
# 2. Use the Token from the first step to perform a Password Reset and set a
#    (new) Password for the User. Again, we perform no specific inspection here.
# 3. Using the newly-specified Password, Sign In the User.
# 4. The `session_data[:current_user]` value is set to the newly-Registered and
#    Signed In User.
#
# ## Intentional Tests
#
# 5. The `session_data[:expires_at]` value is set to a value *before* `Time.now`
#    and `CryptIdent#session_expired?` is called to demonstrate that that is
#    detected.
# 6. The `CryptIdent#update_session_expiry` method is called, and the value for
#    `session_data[:expires_at]` updated from its return value.
# 7. The `CryptIdent#session_expired?` method is called again, to demonstrate
#    that the Session has not Expired.
#
# ## Cleanup
#
# 8. The User is Signed Out and its Entity deleted.
# 9. The Repository is cleared and the Repository object deleted.
#
# For a further discussion of the rationale for these tests, see the commentary
# in `register_and_authenticate_test.rb` in this directory.
