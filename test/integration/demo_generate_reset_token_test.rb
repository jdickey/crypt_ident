# frozen_string_literal: true

# This is an integration test for CryptIdent. Integration tests differ from
# unit tests in that they're more use-case oriented; rather than iteratively
# testing every feature and error handler of a module or class, they demonstrate
# a sequence illustrating how the code would be used to "tell an end-to-end
# story". Development-only tools such as test coverage analysis, or mocks of
# framework classes, aren't used.
#
# This test exercises the following sequence of actions:
#
# ## Setup Steps
#
# 1. Register a New User, capturing the Token for use in the following step. The
#    test *does not* otherwise inspect or verify the Result; that is done by
#    other integration tests.
# 2. Use the Token from the first step to perform a Password Reset and set a
#    (new) Password for the User. Again, we perform no specific inspection here.
#
# At this point, the User exists in the Repository. Consider a hypothetical
# client application's use case, where the User has Signed Up but somehow lost
# the original email (etc) with its included link to a URL which embeds the
# Password Reset Token. She would then use the app's UI to request a new
# Password Reset, which would invoke the `#generate_reset_token` method.
#
# ## Intentional Tests
#
# 3. Using the User Name specified earlier, and no Current User, call the
#    `#generate_reset_token` method, verifying a successful result with a User
#    Entity that:
#    a. has the same User Name;
#    b. has been persisted to the Repository;
#    c. has a future `:password_reset_expires_at` value and a `:token` value.
# 4. Using a different/random User Name, and no Current User, call the
#    method, verifying an unsueccessful result that:
#    a. has a `:code` value of `:user_not_found`
#    b. has the same User Name;
#    c. has a `:current_user` value of the Guest User.
# 5. Using the User Name specified earlier, and a Current User with a different
#    User Name, call the method, verifying an unsuccessful result that:
#    a. has a `:code` value of `:user_logged_in`;
#    b. has a `:name` value of `:unassigned`;
#    c. has a `:current_user` value of the specified Current User.
#
# ## Cleanup
#
# 6. The Repository is cleared and the Repository object deleted.
#
# For a further discussion of the rationale for these tests, see the commentary
# in `register_and_authenticate_test.rb` in this directory.
