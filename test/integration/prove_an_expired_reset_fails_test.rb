# This is an integration test for CryptIdent that demonstrates what happens when
# a Password Reset Token expires before it is used to Reset a User's Password.
# A _successful_ Password Reset is demonstrated by other integration tests. The
# progression here is pretty straightforward:
#
# 1. Using Timecop to travel back in time, Register a New User and obtain the
#    Password Reset Token needed to set an initial password.
# 2. Back in the present, use that Token to attempt a Password Reset.
# 3. Verify that the Password Reset fails.
