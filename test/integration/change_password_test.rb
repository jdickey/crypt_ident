# frozen_string_literal: true

# This is an integration test for CryptIdent. Integration tests differ from
# unit tests in that they're more use-case oriented; rather than iteratively
# testing every feature and error handler of a module or class, they demonstrate
# a sequence illustrating how the code would be used to "tell an end-to-end
# story". Development-only tools such as test coverage analysis, or mocks of
# framework classes, aren't used.
#
# This test exercises the following sequence of actions:
#
# ## Setup Steps
#
# 1. Register a New User, capturing the Token for use in the following step. The
#    test *does not* otherwise inspect or verify the Result; that is done by
#    other integration tests.
# 2. Use the Token from the first step to perform a Password Reset and set a
#    (new) Password for the User. Again, we perform no specific inspection here.
# 3. Using the newly-specified Password, Sign In the User.
#
# ## Intentional Tests
#
# 4. The `#change_password` method is called for the newly-Authenticated User.
#    Remember that the difference between the `#change_password` method and the
#    `#reset_password`method is that the former **must** be performed by an
#    Authenticated User; the latter **must not** be. The result is inspected to
#    verify success.
# 5. Sign Out the User.
# 6. Using the newly-specified Password, Sign In the User. The test inspects
#    the return value from `#sign_in` to verify success.
#
# ## Cleanup
#
# 7. The User is Signed Out.
#
# For a further discussion of the rationale for these tests, see the commentary
# in `register_and_authenticate_test.rb` in this directory.
