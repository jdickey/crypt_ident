# Include and interact with `CryptIdent` to add authentication to a

# @version 0.2.0
module CryptIdent
  # Change an Authenticated User's password.
  #
  # To change an Authenticated User's password, an Entity for that User, the
  # current Clear-Text Password, and the new Clear-Text Password are required.
  # The method accepts an optional `repo` parameter to specify a Repository
  # instance to which the updated User Entity should be persisted; if none is
  # specified (i.e., if the parameter has its default value of `nil`), then the
  # `UserRepository` specified in the Configuration is used.
  #
  # The method *requires* a block, to which a `result` indicating success or
  # failure is yielded. That block **must** in turn call **both**
  # `result.success` and `result.failure` to handle success and failure results,
  # respectively. On success, the block yielded to by `result.success` is called
  # and passed a `user:` parameter, which is identical to the `user` parameter
  # passed in to `#change_password` *except* that the `:password_hash` attribute
  # has been updated to reflect the changed password. The updated value for the
  # encrypted password will also have been saved to the Repository.
  #
  # On failure, the `result.failure` call will yield a `code:` parameter to its
  # block, which indicates the cause of failure as follows:
  #
  # If the specified password *did not* match the passed-in `user` Entity, then
  # the `code:` for failure will be `:bad_password`.
  #
  # If the specified `user` was *other than* a User Entity representing a
  # Registered User, then the `code:` for failure will be `:invalid_user`.
  #
  # Note that no check for the Current User is done here; this method trusts the
  # Controller Action Class that (possibly indirectly) invokes it to guard that
  # contingency properly.
  #
  # @since 0.1.0
  # @authenticated Must be Authenticated.
  # @param [User] user_in The User Entity from which to get the valid Encrypted
  #                 Password and other non-Password attributes
  # @param [String] current_password The current Clear-Text Password for the
  #                 specified User
  # @param [String] new_password The new Clear-Text Password to encrypt and add
  #                 to the returned Entity, and persist to the Repository
  # @return (void) Use the `result` yield parameter to determine results.
  # @yieldparam result [Dry::Matcher::Evaluator] Indicates whether the attempt
  #               to create a new User succeeded or failed. Block **must**
  #               call **both** `result.success` and `result.failure` methods,
  #               where the block passed to `result.success` accepts a parameter
  #               for `user:` (which is the newly-created User Entity). The
  #               block passed to `result.failure` accepts a parameter for
  #               `code:`, which is a Symbol reporting the reason for the
  #               failure (as described above).
  # @yieldreturn (void) Use the `result.success` and `result.failure`
  #               method-call blocks to retrieve data from the method.
  #

  #     user_in = session[:current_user]

  #         flash[config.success_key] = "User #{user.name} password changed."
  #         redirect_to routes.root_path
  #       end
