# Include and interact with `CryptIdent` to add authentication to a
# Hanami controller action.
#
# Note the emphasis on *controller action*; this module interacts with session
# data, which is quite theoretically possible in an Interactor but practically
# *quite* the PITA. YHBW.

# @author Jeff Dickey
# @version 0.2.0
module CryptIdent
  # Attempt to Authenticate a User, passing in an Entity for that User (which
  # **must** contain a `password_hash` attribute), and a Clear-Text Password.
  # It also passes in the Current User.
  #
  # If the Current User is not a Registered User, then Authentication of the
  # specified User Entity against the specified Password is accomplished by
  # comparing the User Entity's `password_hash` attribute to the passed-in
  # Clear-Text Password.
  #
  # The method *requires* a block, to which a `result` indicating success or
  # failure is yielded. That block **must** in turn call **both**
  # `result.success` and `result.failure` to handle success and failure results,
  # respectively. On success, the block yielded to by `result.success` is called
  # and passed a `user:` parameter, which is the Authenticated User (and is the
  # same Entity as the `user` parameter passed in to `#sign_in`).
  #
  # On failure, the `result.failure` call will yield a `code:` parameter to its
  # block, which indicates the cause of failure as follows:
  #
  # If the specified password *did not* match the passed-in `user` Entity, then
  # the `code:` for failure will be `:invalid_password`.
  #
  # If the specified `user` was not a Registered User, then the `code:` for
  # failure will be `:user_is_guest`.
  #
  # If the specified `current_user` is *neither* the Guest User *nor* the `user`
  # passed in as a parameter to `#sign_in`, then the `code:` for failure will be
  # `:illegal_current_user`.
  #
  # On *success,* the Controller-level client code **must** set:
  #
  # * `session[:expires_at]` to the expiration time for the session. This is
  #   ordinarily computed by adding the current time as returned by `Time.now`
  #   to the `:session_expiry` value in the current configuration.
  # * `session[:current_user]` to tne returned *Entity* for the successfully
  #   Authenticated User. This is to eliminate possible repeated reads of the
  #   Repository.
  #
  # On *failure,* the Controller-level client code **should** set:
  #
  # * `session[:expires_at]` to some sufficiently-past time to *always* trigger
  #   `#session_expired?`; `Hanami::Utils::Kernel.Time(0)` does this quite well
  #   (returning midnight GMT on 1 January 1970, converted to local time).
  # * `session[:current_user]` to either `nil` or the Guest User.
  #
  # @since 0.1.0
  # @authenticated Must not be Authenticated as a different User.
  # @param [User] user_in Entity representing a User to be Authenticated.
  # @param [String] password Claimed Clear-Text Password for the specified User.
  # @param [User, nil] current_user Entity representing the currently
  #               Authenticated User Entity; either `nil` or the Guest User if
  #               none.
  # @return (void) Use the `result` yield parameter to determine results.
  # @yieldparam result [Dry::Matcher::Evaluator] Indicates whether the attempt
  #               to Authenticate a User succeeded or failed. Block **must**
  #               call **both** `result.success` and `result.failure` methods,
  #               where the block passed to `result.success` accepts a parameter
  #               for `user:` (which is the newly-created User Entity). The
  #               block passed to `result.failure` accepts a parameter for
  #               `code:`, which is a Symbol reporting the reason for the
  #               failure (as described above).
