# CryptIdent Version History

## 0.2.0 (2 February 2018)

Initial *confident* public (pre-)release.

Many bug-fixes; vastly improved documentation; better configuration; and integration tests (`test/integration/*_test.rb`) as the authoritative reference for usage, largely in conjunction with the API Documentation.

Beat on it as you will; feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/jdickey/crypt_ident/issues/new) or join the discussion on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/crypt_ident).

This is *far* more likely to become 1.0.0.

## 0.1.0 (18 December 2018)

Initial public (pre-)release.

"Why isn't this 1.0.0?", you ask. Because nobody, including me, has yet put code using `CryptIdent` into production (internal or otherwise). Therefore, any problems encountered in doing so can be resolved prior to an official 1.0.0 release. After 1.0.0, [semantic-versioning](https://semver.org/) rules apply.
